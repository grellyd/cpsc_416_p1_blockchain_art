Sharon := shape addition validation, add helper to determine how much ink an operation takes. Add ink used field to operation.
Alex := RPC (done), miner -> server (done), applib <-> miner (done), NewMiner (done), NewArtNode (done)
Graham := Restructure and ink generation, serialise and deserialise block; Add field BCLength to retrieve length of BC.
Larissa := miner to miner communication

Phase 2: Blockchain & Blockchain RPC Calls

Alex := implement GetInk(), GetGenesisBlock(), and GetChildren(); think about stubs for BC.

How to run several miners (and apps)
-----------
1. Run key-gen.go (each run 1 set of [Private][Public] keys).
2. Each time copy the values you get somewhere.
3. Run server
4. Run every miner with the arguments 127.0.0.1:12345 [publ][priv]
5. If you want to run an app, you'll need to copy miner's IP:Port from terminal printout (it's randomly picked) and copy private key for that miner.
6. Manually insert into art-app.go private key and IP:Port combination
7. Run App.
